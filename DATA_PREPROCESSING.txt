Machine-learning data_preprocessing

#step1
import the required libraries (numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas)

#step2
import the dataset
use pandas to import the dataset, save your .py file in the folder where the dataset is located
F5 will run the whole file and set the directory as working directory
X will contain all the independant data 
[:, :-1].values = select all the rows and then select all the columns -1 
(which is the purchased column we don't select)
y contains all the dependant data
[:, 3].values = select all from the 3rd column (3 index)

#step3
take care of missing data 
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
imputer will replace the missing values (check imputer help CTRL + I)
imputer.fit() takes the matrix which contains the missing data
and selects on which columns the missing data are present
then we take this column with the index and apply imputer.transform() on it

#step4
encoding the cathegorical data
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
the country and purchased column both contain the same names multiple times
(france, spain, germand, yes and no)
we have to encode this with the label and onehotencoder

#step5
Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
splitting the dataset in a training and test set are required to do
so the machine can learn from the training set and then test its finding with the test set

#step6
we have to apply feature scaling so that the values aren't so far apart
when calculating the eaclidean distance
